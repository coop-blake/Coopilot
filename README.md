# **Coopilot**
A Web Application

You will need [**Docker** and **docker-compose**](https://www.docker.com) to build and run Coopilot using these instructions.

## Getting Balek
Clone the repository and submodules

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/coop-blake/Coopilot.git  

 > The [dojo toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org) is included as a submodule. If the `--recurse-submodules` 
 > flag is omitted durring cloning or you download the zip file, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in 
 > the root directory to download the dojo toolkit submodules.

## Building and Running Coopilot

_Enter the repository root:_

    cd Coopilot

### Build:
Will take a few minutes to complete

    docker-compose -f ./builds/coopilot/docker-compose.yml build
_This builds the mongo and mysql database server containers as well as the node.js container that runs Coopilot_
### Run:
Start up the Balek containers in the background  

    docker-compose -f ./builds/coopilot/docker-compose.yml up -d

### Stop:
Stop the Balek containers  

    docker-compose -f ./builds/coopilot/docker-compose.yml down



## Accessing Coopilot  

Once the containers are up and running you can access your Coopilot instance through [https://localhost/](https://localhost/)

To access the built/minified interface you have to request [https://localhost/release/](https://localhost/release/)  

üìù _The release build should be improved to only serve the release._



## Configuring Coopilot
The configuration directory for the docker build can be found at [`builds/coopilot/conf`](builds/coopilot/conf)
### SSL certificates
Self signed certificates are auto generated along with a directory to hold them durring the build process

You can place your own ssl certificates in the [`builds/coopilot/conf/cert`](builds/coopilot/conf/cert) directory and restart(Stop/Run) your containers to use them.
### Advanced Configuration
Modify [`builds/coopilot/conf/config.json`](builds/coopilot/conf/config.json) and restart containers.  
See the [`src/balek-server/etc/README.md`](src/balek-server/etc/README.md) for more info.
